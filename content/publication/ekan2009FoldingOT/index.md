abstract: The cocaine aptamer is a DNA molecule that binds cocaine at the junction of three helices. The bifunctional spectroscopic probe Ç was incorporated independently into three different positions of the aptamer and changes in structure and dynamics upon addition of the cocaine ligand were studied. Nucleoside Ç contains a rigid nitroxide spin label and can be studied directly by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy after reduction of the nitroxide to yield the fluoroside Çf. Both the EPR and the fluorescence data for aptamer 2 indicate that helix III is formed before cocaine binding. Upon addition of cocaine, increased fluorescence of a fully base-paired Çf, placed at the three-way junction in helix III, was observed and is consistent with a helical tilt from a coaxial stack of helices II and III. EPR and fluorescence data clearly show that helix I is formed upon addition of cocaine, concomitant with the formation of the Y-shaped three-way helical junction. The EPR data indicate that nucleotides in helix I are more mobile than nucleotides in regular duplex regions and may reflect increased dynamics due to the short length of helix I.
