	abstract = {Density functional theory (DFT) is widely applied in calculations of molecules and materials. Yet, it suffers from a well-known over-emphasis on charge delocalization arising from self-interaction error that destabilizes localized states. Here, using the symmetric diamine N,N′-dimethylpiperazine as a model, we have experimentally determined the relative energy of a state with positive charge localized on one of the two nitrogen atoms, and a state with positive charge delocalized over both nitrogen atoms. The charge-localized state was found to be 0.33 (0.04) eV higher in energy than the charge-delocalized state. This provides an important test of theoretical approaches to electronic structure calculations. Calculations with all DFT functionals commonly used today, including hybrid functionals with exact exchange, fail to predict a stable charge-localized state. However, the application of an explicit self-interaction correction to a semi-local functional identifies both states and gives relative energy in excellent agreement with both experiment and CCSD(T) calculations.},

@article{Ivanov:2021ab,
	abstract = {The energy minimization involved in density functional calculations of electronic systems can be carried out using an exponential transformation that preserves the orthonormality of the orbitals. The energy of the system is then represented as a function of the elements of a skew-Hermitian matrix that can be optimized directly using unconstrained minimization methods. An implementation based on the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno approach with inexact line search and a preconditioner is presented and the performance compared with that of the commonly used self-consistent field approach. Results are presented for the G2 set of 148 molecules, liquid water configurations with up to 576 molecules and some insulating crystals. A general preconditioner is presented that is applicable to systems with fractional orbital occupation as is, for example, needed in the k-point sampling for periodic systems. This exponential transformation direct minimization approach is found to outperform the standard implementation of the self-consistent field approach in that all the calculations converge with the same set of parameter values and it requires less computational effort on average. The formulation of the exponential transformation and the gradients of the energy presented here are quite general and can be applied to energy functionals that are not unitary invariant such as self-interaction corrected functionals.},

	abstract = {Coordination chemistry has been a consistently active branch of chemistry since Werner's seminal theory of coordination compounds inaugurated in 1893, with the central focus on transition metal complexes. However, control and measurement of metal--ligand interactions at the single-molecule level remain a daunting challenge. Here we demonstrate an interdisciplinary and systematic approach that enables measurement and modulation of the coordinative bonding forces in a transition metal complex. Terpyridine is derived with a thiol linker, facilitating covalent attachment of this ligand on both gold substrate surfaces and gold-coated atomic force microscopy tips. The coordination and bond breaking between terpyridine and osmium are followed in situ by electrochemically controlled atomic force microscopy at the single-molecule level. The redox state of the central metal atom is found to have a significant impact on the metal--ligand interactions. The present approach represents a major advancement in unravelling the nature of metal--ligand interactions and could have broad implications in coordination chemistry.},

@article{Lehtola:2016aa,
	abstract = {The spurious interaction of an electron with itself-self-interaction error-is one of the biggest problems in modern density-functional theory. Some of its most glaring effects, such as qualitatively incorrect charge separation upon dissociation, can be removed by an approximate self-interaction correction due to Perdew and Zunger (PZ) (Perdew, J.; Zunger, A. Phys. Rev. B 1981, 23, 5048). However, the correction introduces an explicit dependence on the occupied orbital densities, which makes proper minimization of the functional difficult. Previous work (Vydrov et al., J. Chem. Phys. 2006, 124, 094108) has suggested that the application of the PZ correction results in worse atomization energies than those obtained with the uncorrected parent functional. But, it has only recently been found that the correct minimization of the PZ energy functional requires complex-valued orbitals, which have not been used in previous work on atomization energies. Here, we study the effect of the proper use of complex-valued orbitals on the atomization energies of molecules in the W4-11 data set (Karton, A.; Daon, S.; Martin, J. M. Chem. Phys. Lett. 2001, 510, 165). We find that the correction has a tendency to weaken the binding of molecules. The correction using complex-valued orbitals is invariably found to yield better atomization energies than the correction with real-valued orbitals. The correction applied to the PBEsol exchange-correlation functional results in a functional that is more accurate than the (uncorrected) PBE functional.},

@article{Kirchhoff:2021aa,
	abstract = {In hybrid simulations, such as the QM/MM approach, the system is partitioned into regions that are treated at different levels of theory. The key question then becomes how to evaluate the interactions between particles on opposite sides of the boundary. One approach is to place the boundary in such a way that particles near the boundary on both sides are of the same type, thus simplifying the evaluation of the interactions. If mobile particles are present, such as solvent molecules, and particles are allowed to cross the boundary, the conservation of energy and atomic forces is problematic unless the computational effort is increased significantly. By preventing particles from crossing the boundary but allowing the boundary to be flexible, an accurate estimate of average thermodynamic properties is obtained in principle as illustrated by the flexible inner region ensemble separator (FIRES) method [C. Rowley and B. Roux, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2012, 8, 3526]. In FIRES, a harmonic restraint is applied to particles near the boundary. Therefore, it can occur that particle cross the boundary to some extent resulting in anomalies in the particle density. Here, a constraint approach is presented where particles instantaneously scatter from the boundary. This scattering-adapted FIRES (SAFIRES) implementation makes use of a variable-time-step propagation algorithm where the time step is scaled automatically to identify the moment a collision should occur. If the length of the time step is kept constant, this propagator reduces to a regular Langevin dynamics algorithm, and to the velocity Verlet algorithm for conservative dynamics if the friction coefficient is set to zero. Correct average ensemble statistics are obtained as demonstrated in simulations where, for testing purposes, the particles in the two regions are treated at the same level of theory, namely, a homogeneous Lennard-Jones (LJ) liquid and liquid water based on the TIP4P potential function. In order to illustrate this approach in solid-liquid interface simulations, a LJ liquid in contact with the surface of a crystal is also simulated. The simulations using SAFIRES are shown to reproduce the unconstrained reference simulations without significant deviations in the particle density and the dynamics are shown to conserve energy when coupling to the heat bath is turned off.},

GPAW is based on the projector-augmented wave method and can solve the self-consistent density functional theory (DFT) equations using three different wave-function representations, namely real-space grids, plane waves, and numerical atomic orbitals. The three representations are complementary and mutually independent and can be connected by transformations via the real-space grid. This multi-basis feature renders GPAW highly versatile and unique among similar codes. By virtue of its modular structure, the GPAW code constitutes an ideal platform for the implementation of new features and methodologies. Moreover, it is well integrated with the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE), providing a flexible and dynamic user interface. In addition to ground-state DFT calculations, GPAW supports many-body GW band structures, optical excitations from the Bethe--Salpeter Equation, variational calculations of excited states in molecules and solids via direct optimization, and real-time propagation of the Kohn--Sham equations within time-dependent DFT. A range of more advanced methods to describe magnetic excitations and non-collinear magnetism in solids are also now available. In addition, GPAW can calculate non-linear optical tensors of solids, charged crystal point defects, and much more. Recently, support for graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration has been achieved with minor modifications to the GPAW code thanks to the CuPy library. We end the review with an outlook, describing some future plans for GPAW.}},

@article{Kirchhoff:2023aa,
	abstract = {The effect of solvation on the free energy of reaction intermediates adsorbed on electrocatalyst surfaces can significantly change the thermochemical overpotential, but accurate calculations of this are challenging. Here, we present computational estimates of the solvation energy for reaction intermediates in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on a B-doped graphene (BG) model system where the overpotential is found to reduce by up to 0.6 V due to solvation. BG is experimentally reported to be an active ORR catalyst but recent computational estimates using state-of-the-art hybrid density functionals in the absence of solvation effects have indicated low activity. To test whether the inclusion of explicit solvation can bring the calculated activity estimates closer to the experimental reports, up to 4 layers of water molecules are included in the simulations reported here. The calculations are based on classical molecular dynamics and local minimization of energy using atomic forces evaluated from electron density functional theory. Data sets are obtained from regular and coarse-grained dynamics, as well as local minimization of structures resampled from dynamics simulations. The results differ greatly depending on the method used and the solvation energy estimates are deemed untrustworthy. It is concluded that a significantly larger number of water molecules is required to obtain converged results for the solvation energy. As the present system includes up to 139 atoms, it already strains the limits of computational feasibility, so this points to the need for a hybrid simulation approach where efficient simulations of much larger number of solvent molecules is carried out using a lower level of theory while retaining the higher level of theory for the reacting molecules as well as their near neighbors and the catalyst. The results reported here provide a word of caution to the computational catalysis community: activity predictions can be inaccurate if too few solvent molecules are included in the calculations.},

	abstract = {Results of Perdew--Zunger self-interaction corrected (PZ-SIC) density functional theory calculations of the atomization energy of 35 molecules are compared to those of high-level quantum chemistry calculations. While the PBE functional, which is commonly used in calculations of condensed matter, is known to predict on average too high atomization energy (overbinding of the molecules), the application of PZ-SIC gives a large overcorrection and leads to significant underestimation of the atomization energy. The exchange enhancement factor that is optimal for the generalized gradient approximation within the Kohn-Sham (KS) approach may not be optimal for the self-interaction corrected functional. The PBEsol functional, where the exchange enhancement factor was optimized for solids, gives poor results for molecules in KS but turns out to work better than PBE in PZ-SIC calculations. The exchange enhancement is weaker in PBEsol and the functional is closer to the local density approximation. Furthermore, the drop in the exchange enhancement factor for increasing reduced gradient in the PW91 functional gives more accurate results than the plateaued enhancement in the PBE functional. A step towards an optimal exchange enhancement factor for a gradient dependent functional of the PZ-SIC form is taken by constructing an exchange enhancement factor that mimics PBEsol for small values of the reduced gradient, and PW91 for large values. The average atomization energy is then in closer agreement with the high-level quantum chemistry calculations, but the variance is still large, the F2 molecule being a notable outlier.},
