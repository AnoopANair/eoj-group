abstract: The structure of the solvation shell of the aqueous Fe<sup>3+</sup> ion has been a subject of controversy due to discrepancies between experiments and different levels of theory. We address this issue by performing simulations for a wide range of ion concentrations, using various potential energy functions, supplemented by density functional theory calculations of selected configurations. The solvation shell undergoes abrupt transitions between two states,  a hexacoordinated octahedral (OH) state and a capped trigonal prism (CTP) state with 7-fold coordination. The lifetime of these states is dependent on concentration. In dilute FeCl<sub>3</sub> solutions, the lifetimes of both are similar (≈1 ns). However, the lifetime of the OH state increases with ion concentration, while that of the CTP state decreases slightly. When a uniform negative background charge is used instead of explicit counterions, the lifetime of the OH state is greatly overestimated. These findings underscore the need for further experimental measurements and higher-level simulations.
